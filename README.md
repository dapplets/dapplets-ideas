#Some dapplet ideas
Today we're at the very beginning of our journey. The technology has been developed, but application options are still emerging.

##We see a lot of development ideas:
Public Stickers - a dapplet that allows users to place stickers directly on public content

Total Comments - a universal dapplet that allows its users to annotate the content of any website 

Tips & Donations - a dapplet that lets users send tips to content creators and contributors. This can work in different communities, different blockchains, and tokens. 

Avatar NFT Augmentations - Avatar augmentation - clothes, accessories, gadgets, and bodies for your Avatar. In the form of NFTs that can be bought, sold, and traded.

Instant NFT Minting - a dapplet that allows its user to turn any content (e.g. a social media post) into an NFT.

Instant Message Encryption - a dapplet that can encrypt texts as they are being written. To retain privacy and protect users from message parsing by web crawlers.

Universal Chat - a dapplet with an online chat that’s displayed on top of any website. It allows users to have direct discussions anywhere within the content’s framework.

Site Reviews - a dapplet that provides independent and unstoppable site and project reviews, with undeletable comments, and ratings, all stored in blockchain.

Avatar Trolling - a dapplet that provides the opportunity to change other users' avatars and draw something on top.
